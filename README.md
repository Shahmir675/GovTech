## Technical Details

- **PDF Processing**: Uses PyPDF2 for text extraction and LangChain for intelligent chunking
- **Vector Storage**: Qdrant Cloud for scalable vector storage and similarity search
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic understanding
- **Chat Interface**: Streamlit for responsive web UI
- **AI Response**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for generating contextual answers

## Precision Mode (Cleaner, Surgical Citations)

- Retrieval applies semantic + keyword thresholds to discard loosely related passages.
- Cross-encoder re-ranking (if available) prioritizes contextually tight matches.
- Results are de-duplicated per section/schedule and trimmed to relevant snippets.
- Max citations per answer are capped (default 4) to prevent citation-stuffing.
- Pinpoint citations (e.g., Section 55(1)(c)) are generated when subsection cues are detected.
- If the Act lacks an explicit mechanism asked by the user (e.g., independent arbitration), the answer states this absence clearly.

Configure citation cap via environment variable:

```
RAGBOT_MAX_CITATIONS=4
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **API Key Issues**: Ensure all API keys are correctly set in `.env`
2. **Connection Problems**: Check your internet connection and API key validity
3. **PDF Processing Errors**: Ensure the PDF file exists in the project directory
4. **Empty Responses**: Verify the document was loaded successfully
